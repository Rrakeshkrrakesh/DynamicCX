A user has attributes = EV, Solar & Budget Billing user) for a particular user (SMB/Resi), Fuel (Electric/Gas/Water) and Meter Type (AMI/AMR/NSM)?\n\nLet's understand the logic to be followed for \"Last month\" & \"Current Month\" section by taking an example of a Resi_Electric_AMI user with user attributes of EV, Solar & Demand Charge. Assume \"Solar energy flow\" widget has been TURNED OFF by the utility\n\nStep 1: Identify all \"applicable\" widgets that are meant to be displayed as per multiple user attributes:\na) Create a list of widgets with nonzero relative order value. \nFor our example, we've following widgets with nonzero relative order for EV, Solar & Demand Charge\n\nLast month section\n- Bill summary\n- Bill itemization\n- Solar Energy Flow\n- Demand charge \n\nCurrent month section\n- Bill Projection\n- TOU Usage Distribution\n\n\nb) Remove any widget with relative order value = 0 in the list generated in (a)\n\nFor our example, we've \"Bill Projection\" with relative order = 0 for Solar in the \"Current Month\" section. The updated list is as follows\n\nLast month section\n- Bill summary\n- Bill itemization\n- Solar Energy Flow\n- Demand charge \n\nCurrent month section\n- TOU Usage Distribution\n\nc) Remove any widget that has been turned off by the utility. This is the list of all \"Applicable Widgets\" for the user. \n\nFor our example, utility had decided to turn off \"Solar Energy Flow\". Thus the list of \"applicable widgets\" \n\nLast month section\n- Bill summary\n- Bill itemization\n- Solar Energy Flow\n- Demand charge \n\nCurrent month section\n- TOU Usage Distribution\n\nStep 2: Derive relative order of all apllicable widgets obtained in step 1 (c) using the logic below.\n\nThis precendence order is followed to arrive at the final order of the widgets EV > TOU > SOLAR > BUDGET BILLING > DEMAND CHARGE. \nStart with initial count of applicable widgets without order: WIDGET_WTHOUT_ORDER = N\na) This means for all applicable widgets, widgets applicable for EV would be displayed first in the relative order defined in the EV column. \nUpdate WIDGET_WTHOUT_ORDER = N - widgets ordered in this step. WIDGET_WTHOUT_ORDER = 1 then assign last relative order (N). DON'T go to next step.  \nb) Then among the remaining applicable widgets, TOU widgets would be displayed in the relative order defined in the TOU column.\nUpdate WIDGET_WTHOUT_ORDER = N - widgets ordered in this step. WIDGET_WTHOUT_ORDER = 1 then assign last relative order (N). DON'T go to next step.\nc) Then among the remaining applicable widgets, SOLAR widgets would be displayed in the relative order defined in the SOLAR column.\nUpdate WIDGET_WTHOUT_ORDER = N - widgets ordered in this step. WIDGET_WTHOUT_ORDER = 1 then assign last relative order (N). DON'T go to next step.\nd) Then among the remaining applicable widgets, BUDGET BILLING widgets would be displayed in the relative order defined in the BUDGET BILLING column.\nUpdate WIDGET_WTHOUT_ORDER = N - widgets ordered in this step. WIDGET_WTHOUT_ORDER = 1 then assign last relative order (N). DON'T go to next step.\ne) Then among the remaining applicable widgets, DEMAND CHARGE widgets would be displayed in the relative order defined in the DEMAND CHARGE column.\n\n\n\nLet's understand this using 2 examples.\n\nExample 1: Continuing our initial example in step 1 \nWe have following applicable widgets in the \"Last month\" section\n- Bill summary\n- Bill itemization\n- Demand charge \n\nWIDGET_WTHOUT_ORDER = 3 (total number of applciable widgets are 3 as listed above)\n\nNow let's apply our logic step by step:\na) Widgets applicable for EV are \"Bill Summary\" and \"Bill Itemization\", therefore these widgets would be displayed first in the relative order mentioned in \"EV\" column.\nBill Summary - 1\nBill Itemization - 2\n\nNow we've relative orders for \"Bill Summary\" and \"Bill Itemization\" widgets. The remaing applicable widgets without any relative order is \"Demand charge\"\nWIDGET_WTHOUT_ORDER = 3-2 = 1 (Since 2 widgets have been assigned relative order in this step). \n\nSince WIDGET_WTHOUT_ORDER = 1, the last widget \"DEMAND CHARGE\" widget is assigned a relative order = N= 3. We will not go to the next step now as per our logic.\n\nThus, final relative orders for all widgets are as follows:\nBill Summary - 1\nBill Itemization - 2\nDemand Charge - 3\n\nExample 2: In our previous example let's take a scenario where a utility did not decide to TURN OFF \"Solar Energy Flow\" widget. \nIn such case, the list of applicable widget is updated below for the \"Last Month\" section.\n\nWe have following applicable widgets in the \"Last month\" section\n- Bill summary\n- Bill itemization\n- Solar Energy Flow\n- Demand charge \n\nWIDGET_WTHOUT_ORDER = 4 (total number of applciable widgets are 4 as listed above)\n\nNow let's apply our logic step by step:\na) EV: Widgets applicable for EV are \"Bill Summary\" and \"Bill Itemization\", therefore these widgets would be displayed first in the relative order mentioned in \"EV\" column.\nBill Summary - 1\nBill Itemization - 2\n\nNow we've relative orders for \"Bill Summary\" and \"Bill Itemization\" widgets. \nWIDGET_WTHOUT_ORDER = 4-2 = 2. Remaining applicable widgets are \"Solar Energy Flow\" and \"Demand Charge\"\n\nSince WIDGET_WTHOUT_ORDER = 2,Go to the next step now as per our logic.\n\nb) TOU: Among the remaining widgets applicable, no widget is the applicable for TOU, no widget would be assigned a relative order.\nBill Summary - 1\nBill Itemization - 2\n\nWIDGET_WTHOUT_ORDER = 4-2 = 2 (Since 2 widgets have been assigned relative order in this step). \n\nSince WIDGET_WTHOUT_ORDER = 2. Go to the next step now as per our logic.\n\nc) SOLAR: Among the remaining widgets applicable, \"Solar Energy Flow\" is the only widget applicable for SOLAR, therefore these widgets would be displayed first in the relative order mentioned in \"EV\" column.\nBill Summary - 1\nBill Itemization - 2\nSolar Energy Flow - 3 \n\nNow we've relative orders for \"Bill Summary\",  \"Bill Itemization\" & \"Solar Energy Flow\" widgets. The remaining applicable widgets without any relative order is \"Demand charge\"\nWIDGET_WTHOUT_ORDER = 4-3 = 2 (Since 3 widgets have been assigned relative order in this step). \n\nSince WIDGET_WTHOUT_ORDER = 1, the last widget \"DEMAND CHARGE\" widget is assigned a relative order = N= 3. We will not go to the next step now as per our logic.\n\nThus, final relative orders for all widgets are as follows:\nBill Summary - 1\nBill Itemization - 2\nSolar Energy Flow - 3 \nDemand Charge - 4\n",
